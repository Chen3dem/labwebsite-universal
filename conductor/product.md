# Product Definition: The CUI Lab Website

## 1. Vision & Objective

The primary objective of this lab website is to serve as a comprehensive, dynamic, and public-facing platform for the **CUI Lab**. It will act as a central hub for the lab's activities and identity, designed to:

1.  **Showcase Research:** Effectively disseminate research publications, highlight ongoing projects, and share key findings with the global academic community, with a primary focus on the **structural basis of mTORC1 activation on the lysosomal membrane** and the **signaling mechanisms of the mTORC1–TFEB–Rag–Ragulator megacomplex**.
2.  **Attract Talent:** Serve as an appealing recruitment tool for attracting high-caliber graduate students and postdoctoral fellows by showcasing the lab's vibrant culture, team, and research opportunities.
3.  **Share Resources:** Provide a centralized platform for sharing valuable resources, datasets, or software developed by the lab, contributing to open science.

## 2. Target Audience

The website will be designed to cater to the following audiences:

-   **Primary:**
    -   **Academic Peers & Researchers:** Colleagues in the field seeking to understand the lab's research and explore potential collaborations.
    -   **Prospective Students & Postdocs:** Talented individuals looking for research positions who want to evaluate the lab's environment, projects, and mentorship.
-   **Secondary:**
    -   **Grant Agencies & Industry Partners:** Organizations evaluating the lab's impact, productivity, and potential for funding or partnership.
    -   **General Public:** Individuals with an interest in the lab's area of science.

## 3. Key Features & Pages

Inspired by the structure and functionality of sites like `nassourlab.com`, the website will include the following key sections:

-   **Home:** A dynamic landing page that provides a high-level overview of the lab's mission, latest news, and quick links to other key sections.
-   **Research:** A detailed section outlining the lab's broad research projects, focusing on lysosomal signaling and cellular nutrient sensing. Each project will have its own dedicated page with descriptions, structural models, and related team members.
-   **Team:** An introduction to all lab members (PI, postdocs, students, staff), featuring individual profiles with photos, bios, and links to their publications or professional profiles.
-   **Publications:** A comprehensive and filterable list of the lab's publications, including the groundbreaking work published in Nature on mTORC1 complexes.
-   **What's New (News & Fun):** A blog-style section for sharing lab news, achievements, social events, and other activities to showcase the lab's culture.
-   **Contact & Join Us:** A unified page providing the lab's contact information, a map to its physical location, details on open positions, and instructions for the application process.

## 4. Content Management

To ensure the website remains current and is easy to update, it will be integrated with a headless Content Management System (CMS).

-   **Chosen CMS:** **Sanity.io**
-   **Workflow:** This will allow non-technical lab members to manage and update content (e.g., add new publications, update team member profiles, post news) through a user-friendly admin dashboard, without needing to modify the underlying codebase. The website will automatically fetch and display the latest content from the CMS.
